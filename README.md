### Technologies Used

+ Java
+ Object Oriented / Inheritance
+ Markdown
+ Encapsulation
+ Superclass and subclass

### Lessons Learned

I learned that `private` isn't visible to subclasses.
I learned that changes made to the Superclass are passed on or the subclass
Inherit these changes. This makes managing code to changing conditions faster
and easier.
